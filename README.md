OpenCVUnixInstallScript
=======================

OpenCV Ubuntu/Rasp Pi Install

Modified shell script to install openCV on a Linux machine.

Tested against a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04 and Raspberry Pi Developer VM.

Will publish original author when I can find original source.

To run:
    Open a new terminal
    Create a new directory example:
        cd
        mkdir opencv
    Download opencv_install.sh into this directory
    make file executable:
        chmod +x opencv_install.sh
    run the file:
        ./opencv_install.sh
        or
        sudo ./opencv_install
